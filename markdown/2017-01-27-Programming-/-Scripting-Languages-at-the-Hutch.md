Programming / Scripting Languages at the Hutch

**The purpose of this list is to provide an inventory of programming languages used by more than one Hutch department. It can also provide some guidance for staff who want to learn a new language**

**Strategic Languages *)**

HDC & CIT are hiring staff with these skills and staff in these areas are encouraged to learn one or more of these languages.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Python</td>
    <td>Most widely used programming language at the Hutch (Research groups, IT, SciComp). Default interface language for many cloud computing services (e.g. AWS, Google) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>R</td>
    <td>Most used programming language by scientific users (especially Statisticians / Data Scientists)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C# </td>
    <td>Standard Programming Language for most software engineers  in HDC, CIT & CDS, now also runs on Linux  (dotnet core)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Javascript</td>
    <td>Essential language for interactive web applications (often comes in the form of a js framework). The only programming language that runs directly inside a web browser.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Powershell </td>
    <td>Standard scripting language for Windows systems administrators </td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Common Languages **

Common Languages are used by specific projects or tasks. HDC and CIT are not specifically hiring these skills and staff is encouraged to focus on strategic languages 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>SAS</td>
    <td>Used by many groups, (e.g. Clinical statistics, HICOR, SCHARP, SWOG, WHI)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bash & brothers</td>
    <td>Most used scripting language for HPC (TCSH and ZSH are also used by some)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C / C++</td>
    <td>Used for some performance critical scientific apps or R modules </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Java</td>
    <td>Used by some research groups and SR labs </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Matlab</td>
    <td>Small but stable community around the Hutch </td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Experimental / Upcoming Languages **

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Julia </td>
    <td>Julia is a language for computational science that has gained some excitement lately </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Scala </td>
    <td>Scala is the native language for Spark which will play a bigger role as Spark becomes common</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Expired Languages **

Expired languages may still be used by some legacy workflows, however HDC / CIT will no longer support code or tools written in these languages. Staff is encouraged to learn one of the strategic languages  

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Perl</td>
    <td>Outdated & code hard to maintain, several departments explicitly forbid use of Perl </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ruby</td>
    <td>Ruby used to be a challenger for python, it has lost traction and mindshare.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Visual Basic (e.g. Access) </td>
    <td>Access applications are still developed, mostly these are proof of concept apps which are then sometimes moved into production. VB continues to play a role in office automation (Word, Excel) but staff is encouraged to move to powershell and C# </td>
  </tr>
</table>
